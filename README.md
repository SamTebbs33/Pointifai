# Pointifai
## A pointless game for pointless people

A game created for BrumHack 3.0, part of the MLH EU Fall 2015 season. The game combines the [Clarifai API](http://clarifai.com/) and [Pointless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointless_(game_show)), so players can compete against each other to guess the most obscure tag that Clarifai returns for an image.
